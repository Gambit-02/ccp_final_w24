            <h2>Double Chocolate Cookies</h2>
            <img src="images/double_chocolate_cookies.jpg" width=40% alt="Chocolate cookies with chocolate chips in them on a baking rack">

            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <img src="images/Chocolate-Banana-Bread.jpg" width=40% alt="A close-up image of a chocolate chip banana bread slice with 2 other slices in the background">

            <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>

                <li>Cooking Spray</li>

                <li>In a large bowl, mix egg, egg yolk, granulated sugar, butter, sour cream, and vanilla. Add bananas and stir until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to banana mixture until just combined.</li>
